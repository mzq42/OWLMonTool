# OWLMonTool

This repository contains code of a prototypical implementation of an algorithm for runtime verification using temporalised description logics.

To run the program you need LTL2BA4J, which can be downloaded [here](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/~ebodde/rv/ltl2ba4j/).  You have to put the `ltl2ba4j.jar` file in the `lib/` directory, and the `c-lib/` directory that is shipped with LTL2BA4J needs to be copied also.  It might be necessary to re-compile the LTL2BA part for your architecture.
